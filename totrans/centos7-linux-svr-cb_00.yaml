    With the advent of CentOS 7 in mid 2014, there has been a long list of significant
    changes and new features to this famous operating system. To name a few, there
    is a new installer, suite of system management services, firewall daemon, enhanced
    Linux container support, and a new standard filesystem. With all these new advances
    in the operating system, a major part of the recipes from the *CentOS 6 Linux
    Server Cookbook* became obsolete or even non-functional, making an update of the
    book''s original content essential. But this book is not just a refresher of the
    topics covered in the first edition: two brand new chapters have been included
    as well to keep up to date with the latest open source technologies as well as
    providing better security: operating system-level virtualization and SELinux.
    Finally, to make the book a more comprehensive server-administration book, another
    chapter about server monitoring has been included as well.'

    of times and frustrating at the worst of times. They can represent the biggest
    of problems or give you a great sense of pride and achievement. Where the word
    "server" can describe many things, it is the intention of this book to lift the
    lid and expose the inner workings of this enterprise-class computing system with
    the intention of enabling you to build your professional server solution of choice.
    CentOS is a community-based enterprise class operating system. It is available
    free of charge, and as a fully compatible derivative of Red Hat Enterprise Linux
    (RHEL), it represents the first choice operating system for organizations, companies,
    professionals, and home users all over the world who intend to run a server. It's
    widely respected as a very powerful and flexible Linux distribution and regardless
    of whether you intend to run a web server, file server, FTP server, domain server,
    or a multi-role solution, it is the purpose of this book to deliver a series of
    turnkey solutions that will show you how quickly you can build a fully capable
    and comprehensive server system using the CentOS operating system. So with this
    in mind, you could say that this book represents more than just another introduction
    to yet another server-based operating system. This is a cookbook about an enterprise-class
    operating system that provides a step-by-step approach to making it work. So,
    regardless of whether you are a new or an experienced user, there is something
    inside these pages for everyone, as this book will become your practical guide
    to getting things done and a starting point to all things CentOS.

- en: The requirements of this book are relatively simple and begin with the need
    to download the CentOS operating system. The software is free, but you will need
    a computer that is capable of fulfilling the role of a server, some free installation
    media (blank CD-R/DVD-R or USB device), an Internet connection, some spare time,
    and a desire to have fun.

- en: In saying that, many readers will be aware that you do not need a spare computer
    to take advantage of this book as the option of installing CentOS on virtualization
    software is always available. This approach is quite common and where the recipes
    contained within these pages remain applicable, you should be aware that the use
    of virtualization software is not considered by this book. For this reason, any
    requests for support regarding the use of this software should be directed towards
    the appropriate supplier.

    about CentOS itself, this is a book that will show you how to get CentOS up and
    running. It is a book that has been written with the novice-to-intermediate Linux
    user in mind who is intending to use CentOS as the basis of their next server.
    However, if you are new to operating systems as a whole, then don't worry; this
    book will also serve to provide you with the step-by-step approach you need to
    build a complete server solution with plenty of tricks of the trade thrown in
    for good measure.
