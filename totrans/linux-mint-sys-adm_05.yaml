    machines. In fact, this is one of the most common tasks for the users of this
    kind of operating system. Linux Mint includes thousands of software applications
    that can be installed easily. Remember that when you install the operating system,
    a lot of software is installed by default. Also, it's possible to install additional
    software provided by Linux Mint. In order to facilitate the process of installing
    software in Linux Mint, this operating system includes a tool named **Software
    Manager** .

    be installed in a specific format called a **package** . Software is organized
    in different packages and some applications need more than one package; this fact
    is called package dependency. Linux Mint uses packages in the **Debian** (**DEB**)
    format, same as the Ubuntu Linux and Debian operating systems.
  prefs: []

    for Linux Mint. This tool allows you to list, install, and remove software. Technically,
    Software Manager is a frontend for some commands, such as `apt-get` and `apt-cache`.
    Using a GUI, Software Manager provides an easy and intuitive way to list, install,
    and remove software, avoiding the use of the command-line interface.

    useful word processor. As you must have discovered, it's pretty easy to install
    software through packages provided by Linux Mint. You only need to look for a
    software and click on the **Install** button. Obviously, you can install a lot
    of different software on your machine following the same process.

    installed in Linux Mint, but you can install software distributed in other formats,
    such as tarball and ZIP files as well. However, Mint includes a lot of software
    distributed in DEB packages, so this method of installation is advisable. Actually,
    it's good practice to use Software Manager to install software on your Linux Mint
    operating system.

    be displayed. Each icon represents a different category of software included in
    Linux Mint. For example, you can see the **Internet**, **Sound and Video**, **Graphics**,
    and **Office** categories, among others. By clicking on each one, you'll have
    access to packages belonging to the selected category. You can try and click on
    a category, take a look at the list of packages for that category, and try to
    install one of the packages. This process allows you to discover interesting software
    that can be installed on your machine.

    it's interesting and useful to know how to do the opposite step. You can remove
    installed software on your machine by following a simple process using the Software
    Manager tool. Remember, you can remove software installed by default during the
    installation process of the operating system or remove software that you have
    installed through the Software Manager application.

- en: Between the release cycles, Linux Mint developers upgrade some software that
    is included in the operating system. This means that the system administrators
    should check what software has been upgraded and they should decide which of this
    software should be installed on the machine. Occasionally, upgraded software only
    applies minor changes, such as simple improvements or unimportant bug fixes. However,
    at times upgraded software also includes important security bug fixes. If we don't
    apply them, our machine can be at a serious risk. That's the reason we frequently
    check which software has been upgraded for our Linux Mint version.

    new versions of installed software and to install security upgrades on your machine.
    When you launch that application the first time, you will see only a single item
    in a list for applying upgrades. This item indicates that you need to install
    an upgrade for **mintupdate**, which is the codename of Update Manager. Obviously,
    before applying other upgrades, we need to upgrade the tool itself. Once this
    process is finished, **Update Manager** will be launched again to check which
    software can be upgraded.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The list of software ready to be upgraded displays different items providing
    information about the package name, installed version, and new version available.
    Also, a number for each item is displayed. This number ranges from 1 to 5, and
    it indicates a level based on the importance of the upgrade. Level 1 indicates
    that Linux Mint developers certify that a package and packages marked with this
    level should be upgraded as soon as possible. Usually, security updates use this
    level. The next level is for those packages whose upgrade is recommended by Linux
    Mint developers. Level 3 indicates that it is safe to apply an upgrade, but Linux
    Mint developers didn't test it. Packages marked with level 4 are unsafe, and if
    you upgrade it, the stability of the system can be affected. Finally, level 5
    is for dangerous packages (in the unstable stage of development or with broken
    dependencies), and Linux Mint developers know that they can damage the operating
    system.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In general terms, it's a good idea to launch Software Manager frequently and
    upgrade only those packages marked as level 1 and level 2\. For levels 3, 4, and
    5, system administrators and advanced users should decide about applying upgrades
    or not themselves. Also, you can mark all the packages listed or only a few of
    them. Usually, this is a task of the system administrator; it is he or she who
    takes these kinds of decisions. By default, only packages from level 1 to 3 are
    displayed in the list for upgrading. You can change this preference by going to
    **Edit** | **Preferences**.

    which kind of packages can be installed and from what server. By default, main,
    upstream, and imported packages are selected. Also, it's possible to add additional
    repositories instead of the official ones provided by Mint. For the server, the
    main server of Linux Mint is selected, but you can choose one of the many available
    mirrors.
