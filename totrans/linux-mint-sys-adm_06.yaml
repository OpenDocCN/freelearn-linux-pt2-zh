    devices are working within your computer. Linux Mint offers a graphical tool to
    get information about the hardware installed on your computer. Also, we're going
    to learn how to use commands to display low-level information about devices using
    USB and PCI interfaces.

    on your computer. You can see information about many devices, such as a processor,
    memory, printers, and USB devices connected to your computer. Also, HardInfo offers
    you other relevant information about environment variables, users, or kernel modules
    loaded during boot time.

    you can do it through the **Generate Report** button. This report can be very
    useful to share information about the hardware installed on your computer.

- en: Although, HardInfo is a very intuitive and easy-to-use tool, you also can use
    other commands to get information about hardware installed on your computer. For
    example, `dmesg` is a command that prints on the shell information provided by
    the kernel. This means that if a USB device is connected to your computer, the
    Linux kernel will produce information about this fact; so `dmesg` will get you
    this kind of information.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In order to get data about the USB devices connected to your computer, you can
    execute the `lsusb` command. If you want to get information about your PCI devices,
    the `lspci` command can be used, as it provides you with a complete list of the
    required information.

    your monitor, you can see all your information and data displayed for your computer.
    Several monitors allow you to change some properties, such as screen resolution,
    rotation, and refresh rate. We're going to learn how to change some of these properties

    the graphic tool provided by Mint. You've learned how to change the resolution
    of your screen; along with this, you can also change the rotation and refresh
    rate of your monitor. Also, it's possible to detect which monitor or monitors
    are connected to your computer. Based on this detection, Mint can automatically
    select a better resolution for those monitor/monitors. If you have connected multiple
    monitors, Mint allows you to configure each of them without any problem. Don't
    forget to click on the **Apply** button after changing the properties, otherwise
    your changes won't be applied.

    time for another important peripheral—your keyboard. Linux Mint allows you to
    choose a specific keyboard brand and model, it also adds different layouts and
    configures your keyboard for getting accessibility. In this section, we're going

    there may be some developers whose mother tongue is not English, but they prefer
    to use this kind of layout for programming. However, they need to use another
    different layout for writing in languages such as French or Spanish. Only a single
    layout can be selected at a time, but users can change their layouts at any time.
    Keep in mind that you must add a new layout before using it.

    different aspects such as the brand and model of your keyboard, or decide if the

- en: During the installation process, Linux Mint detects your hardware and installs
    the required drivers for it. Some GNU/Linux distributions don't install or provide
    the proprietary drivers; however, Mint offers us the option to install these kinds
    of drivers. This is a good idea, because it makes life easier to novice users.
    The goal is to get all hardware working inside your computer, including multimedia
    support, monitors, and graphic cards.

    proprietary drivers. If manufactures release source codes, it's possible to compile
    it and to generate binary packages. This is part of the job of Mint developers,
    who provide software to allow us to use our computer with Linux Mint out of the
    box.

    to do that, you can access **Control Center,** and click on the **Additional Drivers**
    button. Then a search process will start and Mint will inform you about which
    additional drivers can be installed.
