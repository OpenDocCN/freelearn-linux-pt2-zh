    and operating system, it''s time to start to do something practical. Before starting
    to use an operating system on our computer, we need to install it. This affirmation
    is not exactly true; some Linux distributions offer a live edition, which allows
    you to test the operating system without installation. Mint is not an exception
    and developers distribute ISO live images. Also, the operating system can be installed
    through the mentioned live images. So, we''ll use one of them as an example. In
    practice, we''ll discover how to install Linux Mint on our computer.*'

    media for burning that image before starting the installation process itself.
    In [Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. Introduction to Linux Mint"), *An Introduction
    to Linux Mint*, we talked about different Linux Mint flavors or editions. Users
    can choose their own edition based on experience, desktop, and computer architecture.
    For simplicity we chose MATE edition for 32-bit, and we'll use that edition for
    learning how to install the operating system. However, the process for creating
    a bootable flash drive and installing Linux Mint is very similar to other editions.

    of capacity at least. Despite you can find different ways for creating bootable
    USB devices, we'll work with a program named **Universal Network Installer** (**UNetbootin**).
    It's an open source program, and you'll find versions for Mac OS X, Windows, and
    GNU/Linux. The process is identical for those three operating systems, so you
    can choose your favorite one.

    a bootable USB drive from an ISO image. Also, it can be used for downloading a
    specific GNU/Linux ISO image from the Internet. Actually, the image can be created
    directly through this option without choosing the ISO file from the system file.
    Debian, Ubuntu, Gentoo, Fedora, and Mint, among others, are GNU/Linux distributions
    supported by `UNetbootin`. However, the last version of this software doesn't
    allow us to download Mint editions greater than 10\. So, we chose to download
    a specific version from one of the official mirrors of Linux Mint, from a web
    browser.
  prefs: []

- en: It's important to fill the input box for the **Space used to preserve file across
    reboots (Ubuntu only):** option, because Linux Mint is a Ubuntu derived distribution.
    The amount of chosen MB depends on the space available on your USB drive. This
    space is reserved for storing some persistent data, such as configuration changes,
    saved pictures, or databases. Thanks to this kind of storage—you can boot and
    use a live operating system without installing it.

    system in a computer. A lot of tasks are executed behind the scenes, and they
    are transparent to the user.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Although the wizard asks you some information for configuring the system, Mint
    copies the files to the hard drive, detects hardware, configures `bootloader`
    and installs all the required software. The process is simple and straightforward,
    so users don't require any experience with Linux distributions for installing
    Linux Mint.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, the most complicated step is when you try to install Linux Mint in
    a computer with different operating systems. Despite that, the wizard will take
    decisions for you; it could be interesting to make sure what you are doing before
    proceeding to format your hard drive. Also, it's possible to select a custom partition
    schema for your hard drive, which is very useful for advanced users. If you are
    not sure about this kind of data, it's better to leave that to the Linux Mint's
    installation wizard, which makes decisions for you. In that case, you can select
    the default options.

    modern hardware non-compatible with Linux. Some users will find problems related
    to this fact, and solving it requires advanced knowledge about Linux kernel. However,
    in most cases, Linux Mint will detect and configure your hardware properly.

    your personal data against other users, you can choose to encrypt your home folder.
    Linux distributions use a specific folder inside the `/home` directory to store
    data for each user of the operating system. Each user is called through the username;
    so for username `joe`, the `home` folder will be `/home/joe`. All personal information
    and custom configuration will be stored in that folder, so it could be worthwhile
    to encrypt it. Remember that you have chosen a username during the installation
    process, and Linux Mint has created that user for you. The name of this user will
    be used for your home folder. Nevertheless, encrypting your `home` folder is considered
    as an advanced feature, and that's the reason we didn't mark the corresponding
    checkbox.
