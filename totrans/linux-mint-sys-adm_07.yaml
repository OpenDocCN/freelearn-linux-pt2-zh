    computer to access a local network, and also access the Internet. Keep in mind
    that before accessing the Internet from a local network, you need to access the

    method for security. This method needs a key, which we need to type. If the network

    are accessible. This happens when you click on the **Network** button of Caja.

    this folder as if they were locally inside your computer.
