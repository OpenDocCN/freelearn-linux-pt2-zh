- en: What is Linux Mint? A short answer to this question is "a computer operating
    system based on Linux kernel and GNU tools and libraries". In order to understand
    what Linux Mint is, first we need to know different concepts such as Linux, kernel,
    and GNU. Formally, Linux is not an operating system. It's just a software component
    working as a bridge between applications and the data processing done by the hardware.
    Because of this fact, the **kernel** is the core component of an operating system.
    Usually, the term *Linux* is used to refer to a whole operating system based on
    the kernel. However, an operating system needs more components to be completed.
    At this point, we find a family of operating system based on Linux kernel, plus
    a set of tools provided by the GNU open source project.

- en: What are GNU tools? Well, first of all we should learn about the GNU project.
    Basically, this is an open source project started by Richard Stallman with the
    goal of building a set of software components and tools to avoid the use of any
    software that is not free. Despite GNU tools are compatible with UNIX operating
    system, both are different. In fact, GNU is a recursive acronym that means GNU's
    Not Unix. Due to the quality and popularity of GNU tools many Unix and Unix-like
    systems, such as GNU/Linux distros, have adopted these tools as components of
    the whole operating system. Belonging to the GNU project, we can find very popular
    tools such as `bash`, `Emacs`, `gzip`, `automake`, `gcc`, and `make`.

- en: Despite the fact that "Linux" is an accepted term to refer to this family of
    operating systems, some people and organizations, such as Free Software Foundation,
    prefer the name GNU/Linux. Keeping this concept in mind, we're going to use GNU/Linux
    in this book while talking about the whole operating system, and just Linux while
    referring to the kernel.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now that we've learned about Linux, kernel, and GNU, we can define Linux Mint
    as a Linux distribution that includes a Linux kernel plus GNU tools and other
    useful software. Hold on. We've just mentioned a new concept—**distribution**
    . For sure, you have heard about Ubuntu, Fedora, or Debian. These three are examples
    of Linux distributions, or **distros**. A Linux distribution can be defined as
    a whole operating system providing a kernel, a system of base tools, and a complete
    set of applications ready to use for users.

- en: Clement Lefebvre is a French developer who decided to build a new Linux distro
    in 2006\. His first goal was to experiment and find out if it was possible to
    apply some design and usability improvements using an existing Linux distro as
    a base. Before making this decision, Clement spent some time writing articles
    about other Linux distributions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Thinking about what things could be improved, Clement started to experiment
    building his own distro. Ubuntu was chosen as the starting point, and after some
    work, the first Linux Mint version was released in 2006 using **Ada** as the code
    name. This version was never released as stable. However, a few months later,
    a new release was ready. Barbara was the chosen name for 2.0 version of Linux
    Mint, which caught the attention and interest of many developers and users. The
    feedback provided by them was a motivation to continue working on the new operating
    system. Linux Mint was starting to become one of the most popular operating systems
    in the world.

    by hundreds of volunteers and contributors. This means that people work together
    sharing ideas, writing tutorials, discussing in forums, and developing software.
    The final result is not only the Linux distro, but a lot of documentation is generated
    as well. Collective intelligence allows us to build one of the most used operating
    systems in the world. We cannot forget that Linux Mint operating system is open
    source, and it's released under the popular **General Public License GPL** (**GNU**)
    software license.

    source world, a community is a set of users and developers supporting a specific
    project. The community of Linux Mint grew up very fast becoming an important and
    essential part of the project.

- en: Everyone can contribute to Mint project in different ways that's the magic of
    open source projects, where the job of each person matters. Usually, people wonder
    how to contribute to open source projects. Sometimes it's hard to find this kind
    of information, especially for non-technical people. The Linux Mint website provides
    enough information about how to contribute to the project. Basically, you can
    find three different areas of contribution—project contributors, promotion, and
    financial help. The first area is for those who want to develop software, write
    documentation, make artwork, or report bugs. However, non-technical people can
    contribute to this area as well, for instance, they can make translations to get
    more and more languages supported. The promotion of the project and distro can
    be for those who are interested in helping others, writing articles, or organizing
    local presentation for spreading the philosophy and the knowledge of the project.
    Finally, financial help is important because Linux Mint project needs to pay some
    costs such as hosting or swag stuff.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Basically, we find three features that make Mint different. The most important
    is the user experience. Mint has been designed to provide a very friendly desktop
    with an elegant and sophisticated look and feel. The main menu gives access to
    applications organized by groups, being very intuitive to launch programs only
    with a click. Regarding improving the user experience, Mint developers offer specific
    tools integrated with the operating system. Some of them include `mintInstall`,
    `mintUpdate`, `mintBackup`, and `mintUpload`. We'll talk about these software
    tools later in different chapters of this book. The impatient user can take a
    look at the GitHub account used by Mint developers at [https://github.com/linuxmint](https://github.com/linuxmint).
  prefs: []

- en: The community behind Linux Mint project is another aspect that makes Mint different
    than other distros. The organizations and the way they work make Mint different.
    The feedback provided by users is one of the most valuable resources to improve
    Mint and to build a better operating system. Other distros have a commercial motivation
    or developers taking decisions without caring about users' requirements, advices,
    or ideas.

- en: Finally, Mint includes a lot of software ready to be used out of the box. Multimedia
    codecs, Java runtime, and Flash Player are installed by default. These feature
    are very important for novice users that need time to get familiarized with the
    operating system.

- en: Editions
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As other operating systems, Linux Mint has different editions or flavors. Basically,
    we can find two main editions—one based on Debian, which is called **Linux Mint
    Debian Edition** (**LMDE**), and another one based in Ubuntu. In addition to Ubuntu
    and Debian software repositories, Linux Mint uses its specific ones.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: LMDE is a rolling release. This means the distro constantly receives updates
    without generating releases. So it doesn't need to be upgraded. However, releases
    for the regular Mint edition (the one based on Ubuntu) are only generated by following
    a specific period of time, this period being longer than the one used for rolling
    release. Despite LMDE being faster and more responsive than Linux Mint, non-advanced
    users should think again before using it because continuous updates can bring
    some errors that they might find difficult to solve. On the other hand, Linux
    Mint is easy to maintain and was designed to offer an unbeatable user experience.
  prefs: []

- en: The Linux Mint project distributes each edition through different ISO images,
    each being ready to be burned in a DVD. For LMDE, we can find four images depending
    on the desktop environment included and the architecture of the processor (32b
    and 64b).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Regarding the regular edition of Linux Mint, we have more options for choosing
    so we need to consider that. Specifically, we can find ten different ISO images.
    Well, we only have five that are really different, because each one has its own
    equivalent in 32b and 64b. Four different desktop environments are included—MATE,
    Cinnamon, KDE, and Xfce.
