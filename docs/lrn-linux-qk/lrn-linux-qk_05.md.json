Options and file arguments can be intermixed arbitrarily, as usual.\n\nFor non-option command-line arguments that are directories, by default \u2018ls' lists the contents of directories, not recursively, and omitting files with names beginning with \u2018.'. For other non-option arguments, by default \u2018ls' lists just the file name. If no non-option argument is specified, \u2018ls' operates on the current directory, acting as if it had been invoked with a single argument of \u2018.'.\n\nBy default, the output is sorted alphabetically, according to the locale settings in effect.(1) If standard output is a terminal, the output is in columns (sorted vertically) and control characters are output as question marks; otherwise, the output is listed one per line and control characters are output as-is.\n\nBecause \u2018ls' is such a fundamental program, it has accumulated many options over the years. They are described in the subsections below; within each section, options are listed alphabetically (ignoring case). The division of options into the subsections is not absolute, since some options affect more than one aspect of \u2018ls''s operation.\n```", "```\nelliot@ubuntu-linux:~$ whatis apropos\napropos (1)          - search the manual page names and descriptions\n```", "```\nelliot@ubuntu-linux:~$ apropos rename\nfile-rename (1p)     - renames multiple files\nFile::Rename (3pm)   - Perl extension for renaming multiple files \ngvfs-rename (1)      - (unknown subject)\nmmove (1)            - move or rename an MSDOS file or subdirectory \nmren (1)             - rename an existing MSDOS file\nmv (1)               - move (rename) files \nprename (1p)         - renames multiple files \nrename (1)           - renames multiple files\nrename.ul (1)        - rename files\n```", "```\nelliot@ubuntu-linux:~$ apropos calendar\ncal (1)              - displays a calendar and the date of Easter\ncalendar (1)         - reminder service\nncal (1)             - displays a calendar and the date of Easter\n```", "```\nelliot@ubuntu-linux:~$ apropos cpu \nchcpu (8)            - configure CPUs\ncpuid (4)            - x86 CPUID access device\ncpuset (7)           - confine processes to processor and memory node subsets \nlscpu (1)            - display information about the CPU architecture\nmsr (4)              - x86 CPU MSR access device\nsched (7)            - overview of CPU scheduling\ntaskset (1)          - set or retrieve a process's CPU affinity\n```", "```\napropos keyword\n```", "```\nelliot@ubuntu-linux:~$ man -k cpu \nchcpu (8)            - configure CPUs\ncpuid (4)            - x86 CPUID access device\ncpuset (7)           - confine processes to processor and memory node subsets \nlscpu (1)            - display information about the CPU architecture\nmsr (4)              - x86 CPU MSR access device\nsched (7)            - overview of CPU scheduling\ntaskset (1)          - set or retrieve a process's CPU affinity\n```", "```\nelliot@ubuntu-linux:~$ cd /usr/share/doc/nano \nelliot@ubuntu-linux:/usr/share/doc/nano$ pwd\n/usr/share/doc/nano\n```", "```\nelliot@ubuntu-linux:/usr/share/doc/nano$ ls\nAUTHORS               copyright faq.html        nano.html   README    TODO \nchangelog.Debian.gz   examples  IMPROVEMENTS.gz NEWS.gz     THANKS.gz\n```"]
