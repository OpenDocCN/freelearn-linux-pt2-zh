## Taking Control of the System

By now, you should be starting to realize that the shell offers an enormous amount of power when it comes to administering your PC. The BASH shell commands give you quick and efficient control over most aspects of your Linux setup. However, the shell truly excels in one area: controlling the processes on your system.

If you are only running a home computer, you may not have to pay much attention to processes. However, if you are running a shared machine or a network, controlling processes can be essential for administration of your system. You can tidy up crashed programs, for example, or even alter the priority of a program so that it runs with a little more consideration for other programs. Unlike with Windows, this degree of control is not considered out of bounds. This is just one more example of how Linux provides complete access to its inner workings and puts you in control.

![images](images/square.jpg) **Tip** This chapter concentrates on using the Terminal to provide powerful control over your system. If you'd rather avoid working in the Terminal but would still like to view and control processes, you can do so in the Processes tab of the System Monitor program. Extra functions are available via the right-click context menu. This interface doesn't provide the advanced level of control that you can get from the shell, though.

### Viewing Processes

A *process* is one instance of a software program, with its associated state. When the user runs a program one or many processes might be started, but they're usually invisible unless the user specifically chooses to manipulate them. You might say that programs exist in the world of the user, but processes belong in the world of the system.

Processes can be started not only by the user, but also by the system itself to undertake tasks such as system maintenance, or even to provide basic functionality, such as the GUI system. Many processes are started when the computer boots up and then they sit in the background, waiting until they're needed (such as programs that provide printing functionality). Other processes are designed to work periodically to accomplish certain tasks, such as ensuring that system files are up to date.

You can see the most active processes currently running on your computer by running the `top` program. For more advanced control, you can also see a complete list of all processes on your computer by using the `ps aux` command. Running `top` is easier, though, because `top` not only shows the most active processes, but also gives you some management options for them. Running `top` is simply a matter of typing the command at the shell prompt.

As you can see in [Figure 26-1](#fig_26_1), `top` provides comprehensive information and can be a bit overwhelming at first sight. However, the main area of interest is the list of processes (which `top` calls *tasks*).

![images](images/2601.jpg)

***Figure 26-1.** The* `top` *program gives you an eagle-eye view of the processes running on your system.*

Here's an example of a line taken from `top` on our test PC, shown with the column headings from the process list:

* * *

`PID USER PR NI VIRT RES SHR S %CPU %MEM TIME+ COMMAND

5499 root 15 0 78052 25m 60m S 2.3 5.0 6:11.72 Xorg`

* * *

A lot of information is presented here, as described in [Table 26-1.](#tab_26_1)

![images](images/t2601.jpg)

This list will probably be longer than the screen has space to display, so `top` orders the list of processes by the amount of CPU time the processes are using and you only see the most active of these processes. Every few seconds, it updates the list. You can test this quite easily. Open a Nautilus file-browsing window (Places ![images](images/U001.jpg) Home) and then let your PC rest for a few seconds, without touching the mouse or typing. Then click an icon in the Nautilus window. You'll see that the process called `nautilus` leaps to the top of the list (or appears very near the top).

Near the top of the list will probably be `Xorg`. This is the program that provides the graphical subsystem for Linux; making the mouse cursor appear to move around the screen and drawing program windows requires CPU time.

![images](images/square.jpg) **Tip** Typing **d** while `top` is running lets you alter the *update interval*, which is the time between screen updates. The default is 3.0 seconds, but you can reduce that to 1 second or even less if you want (that is, a fraction of a second, such as 0.5). However, a constantly updating `top` program starts to consume system resources and can therefore skew the diagnostic results you're investigating. Also, it's virtually impossible to analyze the data that `top` shows if these data get updated every 0.5 seconds. Because of this, a longer, rather than shorter, interval is preferable.

It's possible to alter the ordering of the process list according to other criteria. For example, you can list the processes by the quantity of memory they're using, by typing **M** while `top` is up and running. You can switch back to CPU ordering by typing **P**.

To quit `top`, type **q**.

**RENICING A PROCESS**

You can set how much CPU time a process receives while it's actually running. This is done by *renicing* the process. It isn't something you should do on a regular basis, but it can prove handy if you start a program that then uses a lot of system resources and makes the system unbearably slow.

The first thing to do is to use `top` to spot the process that needs to be restrained and find out its PID number. Renicing is best done as the root user, because in order to protect the system, limitations are placed on what ordinary users can set in terms of CPU scheduling. Run `top` as root by typing **sudo top** (although be careful—with `top` running as root, you can kill any process!). The PID will be listed on the left of the program's entry on the list.

Once you know this, type **r** and then type in the PID number. You'll then be asked to specify a renice value. The scale goes from –20, which is considered the highest priority, to 19, which is considered the lowest. Zero is the median value, and most new user-started processes are given a value of 0\. Therefore, using a value of 19 will ensure that a process stops hogging system resources. However, instead of simply resetting the priority to 19, you should err on the side of caution if you suspect you might be renicing an important process. Check the current niceness, and make only small changes at a time.

After you make adjustments, you should find that some responsiveness has returned to the system, although how much (if any) depends on the nature of the programs you're running.

You might be tempted to bump up the priority of a process to make it run faster, but this may not work the way you want because of complexities in the Linux kernel. In fact, it might cause serious problems. Therefore, you should renice with care and only when you must.

Renicing can also be carried out via the `renice` command at the prompt, avoiding the need to use `top`. Also useful is the `nice` command, which can be used to set the initial priority of a process before it starts to run. To learn more, see the man pages for `renice` and `nice`.

### Controlling Processes

Despite the fact that processes running on your computer are usually hidden away, Linux offers complete, unrestricted control over them. You can terminate processes, change their properties, and learn every item of information there is to know about them.

This provides ample scope for damaging the currently running system but, in spite of this, even standard users have complete control over processes that they personally started (one exception is zombie processes, described a bit later in this section). As you might expect, the root user (or any user who adopts superuser powers) has control over all processes that were created by ordinary users, as well as those processes started by the system itself.

The user is given this degree of control over processes in order to enact repairs when something goes wrong, such as when a program crashes and won't terminate cleanly. It's impossible for standard users to damage the currently running system by undertaking such work, although they can cause themselves a number of problems.

![images](images/square.jpg) **Note** This control over processes is what makes Linux so reliable. Because any user can delve into the workings of the kernel and terminate individual processes, crashed programs can be cleaned up with negligible impact on the rest of the system.

#### Killing Processes

Whenever you quit a program or, in some cases, when it completes the task you've asked it to, it will terminate itself. This means ending its own process and also that of any other processes it created in order to run. The main process is called the *parent*, and the ones it creates are referred to as *child* processes.

![images](images/square.jpg) **Tip** You can see a nice hierarchical display of which parent owns which child process by typing **pstree** at the command-line shell. It's useful to add the `-p` command option (that is, `pstree -p`). This adds the PIDs to the output. It's worth piping this into the `less` command so you can scroll through it: type **pstree | less**. By using a pipe, you send the result of the first command through the pager `less`, which allows you to browse the results page by page.

Although this termination should mean that your system runs smoothly, badly behaved programs sometimes don't go away. They stick around in the process list. Alternatively, you might find that a program crashes and so isn't able to terminate itself. In rare cases, some programs that appear otherwise healthy might get carried away and start consuming a lot of system resources. You can tell when this happens because your system will start slowing down for no reason, as less and less memory and/or CPU time is available to run actual programs.

You can in some cases get rid of these troublesome processes by logging out then immediately logging back in. This works however, only for those processes that you've started after logging in to the computer and not for system processes. Another way to handle them is to kill the process and terminate it manually, with the advantage that this works for all processes and not just a small selection. This is easily done by using `top`.

The first task is to track down the crashed or otherwise problematic process. In `top`, look for a process that matches the name of the program, as shown in [Figure 26-2.](#fig_26_2) For example, the Mozilla Firefox web browser generally runs as a process called `firefox-bin`.

![images](images/2602.jpg)

***Figure 26-2.** You can usually identify a program by its name in the process list.*

![images](images/square.jpg) **Caution** You should be absolutely sure that you know the correct process before killing it. If you get it wrong, you could cause other programs to stop running.

Because `top` doesn't show every single process on its screen, tracking down the trouble-causing process can be difficult. A handy tip is to make `top` show only the processes created by the user you're logged in under. This will remove the background processes started by root. You can do this within `top` by typing **u** and then entering your username.

After you've spotted the crashed process, make a note of its PID number, which will be at the very left of its entry in the list. Then type **k**. You'll be asked to enter the PID number. Enter that number and then press Enter once again (this will accept the default signal value of 15, which tells the program to terminate).

The process (and the program in question) should disappear. If it doesn't, there might be a good reason why you can't terminate the processes. Fortunately, there also is a method to force a process to terminate. Just repeat the same procedure as described previously, but now when `top` asks Kill PID … with signal ]15], don't press Enter to accept this default value, but enter the number **9** and press Enter. This will remove the process with force from your computer. Only do this for processes that you really need to go away, because a process that is terminated this way, won't close its resources nicely and you might lose data.

![images](images/square.jpg) **Note** No magic is involved in killing processes. All that happens is that `top` sends them a “terminate” signal. In other words, it contacts them and asks them to terminate. By default, all processes are designed to listen for commands such as this; it's part and parcel of how programs work under Linux. When a program is described as *crashed*, it means that the user is unable to use the program itself to issue the terminate command (such as Quit). A crashed program might not be taking input, but its *processes* will probably still be running.

#### Controlling Zombie Processes

*Zombie* processes are those that are children of processes that are no longer reachable, for instance because they have terminated. However, for some reason, they failed to take their child processes with them. Zombie processes do occur occasionally.

Often, zombie processes are harmless. In some cases, they can cause confusion and may be the reason why restarting a process doesn't work. That's why you sometimes need to kill them yourself.

In the top-right area of `top`, you can see a display that shows how many zombie processes are running on your system, as shown in [Figure 26-3.](#fig_26_3) Zombie processes are easily identified because they have a `Z` in the status (`S`) column within `top`'s process list. To kill a zombie process, type **k** and then type its PID. Then type **9**, rather than accept the default signal of 15.

![images](images/2603.jpg)

***Figure 26-3.** You can see at a glance how many zombie processes are on your system by looking at the top right of* `top`*'s display.*

In many cases, zombie processes go away by themselves, but in some cases, they don't. When this happens, you have two options. The first is to simply log out and log in again. Alternatively, you can reboot the computer.

#### Using Other Commands to Control Processes

You don't always need to use `top` to control processes. A range of quick and cheerful shell commands can diagnose and treat process problems.

The first of these is the `ps` command. This stands for *process status* and will report a list of currently running processes on your system. This command is typically used with the `aux` command options (there's no need to provide a dash before the options, as with most commands):

`ps aux`

This will return a list something like what you see when you run `top`. If you can spot the problematic process, look for its PID and issue the following command:

`kill <PID number>`

For example, to kill a process with a PID of 5122, you would type this:

`kill 5122`

If, after that, you find the process isn't killed, then you should use the `top` program, as described in the previous sections, because it allows for a more in-depth investigation.

Another handy process-killing command lets you use the actual process name. The `killall` command is handy if you already know from past experience what a program's process is called. For example, to kill the process called `firefox-bin`, which is the chief process of the Firefox web browser, you would use the following command:

`killall firefox-bin`

![images](images/square.jpg) **Caution** Make sure you're as specific as possible when using the `killall` command. Issuing a command like `killall` `bin` will kill all processes that might have the word `bin` in their name!

**CLEARING UP CRASHES**

Sometimes a crashed process can cause all kinds of problems. The shell you're working at may stop working, or the GUI itself might stop working properly.

In cases like this, it's important to remember that you can have more than one instance of the command-line shell up and running at any one time. For example, if a process crashes and locks up GNOME Terminal, simply start a new instance of GNOME Terminal use Ctrl-Alt-t). Then use `top` within the new window to kill the process that is causing trouble for the other terminal window.

If the crashed program affects the entire GUI, you can switch to a virtual console by pressing Ctrl+Alt+F1\. Although the GUI disappears, you will not have killed it, and no programs will stop running. Instead, you've simply moved the GUI to the background while a shell console takes over the screen. Then you can use the virtual console to run `top` and attempt to kill the process that is causing all the problems. When you're ready, you can switch back to the GUI by pressing (Ctrl)+Alt+F7.

If you know the name of the program that's crashed, a quick way of getting rid of it is to use the `pgrep` command. This searches the list of processes for the program name you specify and then outputs the PID number. So if, say, Nautilus had frozen, you could type `pgrep nautilus`. Then you would use the `kill` command with the PID number that's returned.

### Controlling Jobs

Whenever you start a program at the shell, it's assigned a job number. *Jobs* are quite separate from processes and are designed primarily for users to understand what programs are currently doing on the system.

You can see which jobs are running at any one time by typing the following at the shell prompt:

`jobs`

When you run a program, it usually takes over the shell in some way and stops you from doing anything until it's finished what it's doing. However, it doesn't have to be this way. Adding an ampersand symbol (`&`) after the command will cause it to run in the background. This is not much use for commands that require user input, such as `vim` or `top`, but it can be handy for commands that churn away until they're completed.

For example, suppose that you want to decompress a large Zip file. For this, you can use the `unzip` command. As with Windows, decompressing large Zip files can take a lot of time, during which time the shell would effectively be unusable. However, you can type the following to retain use of the shell:

`unzip myfile.zip &`

When you do this, you'll see something similar to the following, although the four-digit number will be different:

* * *

`[1] 7483`

* * *

This tells you that `unzip` is running in the background and has been given job number `1`. It also has been given process number `7483` (although bear in mind that when some programs start, they instantly kick off other processes and terminate the one they're currently running, so this won't necessarily be accurate).

![images](images/square.jpg) **Tip** If you've ever tried to run a GUI program from the shell, you might have realized that the shell is inaccessible while it's running. After you quit the GUI program, the control of the shell is returned to you. By specifying that the program should run in the background with the `&` (ampersand symbol), you can run the GUI program and still be able to type away and run other commands.

You can send several jobs to the background, and each one will be given a different job number. In this case, when you want to switch to a running job, you can type its number. For example, the following command will switch you to the background job assigned the number 3:

`%3`

You can exit a job that is currently running by pressing Ctrl+Z. It will still be there in the background, but it won't be running (officially, it's said to be *sleeping*). To restart it, you can switch back to it, as just described. Alternatively, you can restart it but still keep it in the background. For example, to restart job 2 in the background, leaving the shell prompt free for you to enter other commands, type the following:

`%2 &`

You can bring the command in the background into the foreground by typing the following:

`fg`

When a background job has finished, something like the following will appear at the shell:

* * *

`[1]+            Done unzip myfile.zip`

* * *

Using jobs within the shell can be a good way of managing your workload. For example, you can move programs into the background temporarily while you get on with something else. If you're editing a file in `vim`, you can press Ctrl+Z to stop the program. It will remain in the background, and you'll be returned to the shell, where you can type other commands. You can then resume `vim` later on by typing **fg** or typing % followed by its job number.

You can kill jobs based on their number as well. In that case, you'd use `kill %`<jobnumber>, as in `kill %2` to kill the job with job number 2.

![images](images/square.jpg) **Tip** Also useful is Ctrl+C, which will kill a job that's currently running. For example, if you previously started the `unzip` command in the foreground, pressing Ctrl+C will immediately terminate it. Ctrl+C is useful if you accidentally start commands that take an unexpectedly long time to complete.

**NOHUP**

What if you want to start a command running in a terminal window, but then want to close that terminal window? As soon as you close the window, any processes started within it are also closed. Try this now—type **gcalctool** at the prompt to start the Calculator application and then quit the terminal window.

This happens because, when you quit, the parent process sends any process that it started a hang-up signal. Some processes are designed to ignore the hang-up signal, so in the preceding example not every process will quit when the terminal window does, but most will. As you might expect, the hang-up signal is a remnant of the way UNIX used to work many years ago, when people dialed into computers across slow connections; it is designed to stop processes from continuing to consume resources after the user has hung up the phone and thereby ended the session!

To get around processes quitting like this, you can use the `nohup` command. This stands for *no hang-up*, and in simple terms, it tells the command you specify to stick around, even after the process that started it has ended (technically, the command is told to ignore the `SIGHUP` signal). However, commands run via `nohup` can still be killed in the usual way.

To use `nohup`, simply add it before the command, for example:

`nohup unzip myfile.zip`

If the command requires `sudo` or `gksu` powers, add either of these after the `nohup` command.

Any command output (including error messages) is sent to the file `nohup.out`, which you can then view in a text editor. Note that if you run a command via `nohup` using `sudo` or `gksu`, the `nohup.out` file will have root privileges. If that's the case, you will also have to delete the `nohup.out` file via `sudo` before you can use `nohup` again as an ordinary user—because otherwise, `nohup` will be unable to overwrite the root-owned `nohup.out`.

### Summary

This chapter has covered taking complete control of your system. You looked at what processes are, how they're separate from programs, and how they can be controlled or viewed by using programs such as `top` and `ps`. In addition, you explored job management under BASH. You saw that you can stop, start, and pause programs at your convenience.
